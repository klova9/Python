# Goal:
# Calculate hypothetical cost savings (monthly, yearly, etc) based on implementation of different energy efficiency systems:
#  solar panels
#  geothermal
#  biomass
#  conventional (no change)

# Calculate the time it takes to break even of the different systems
# Graph the results against time
